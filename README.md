# C# Practice Repository

This repository contains various C# practice projects focused on learning and practicing different object-oriented programming concepts, design patterns, and language features.

## Projects

### 1. **LibraryManagementSystem**
A comprehensive library management system demonstrating:
- Object-oriented design principles
- Interface implementation (`INotifiable`, `IReservable`)
- Enum usage for statuses and roles
- Different library item types (Books, eBooks, Magazines)
- User management with member roles
- Analytics functionality

### 2. **Delegates**
Practice with C# delegates and multicast delegates:
- Delegate declaration and usage
- Employee delegate implementation
- Multicast delegate patterns
- Event-driven programming foundations

### 3. **Exception Handling**
Exploration of exception handling mechanisms:
- Try-catch-finally blocks
- Custom exception handling
- Enum usage in error scenarios

### 4. **Indexers**
Implementation and usage of indexers:
- Custom indexer patterns
- Index-based access to objects

### 5. **OfficeTracker**
Asset and office management system:
- Asset tracking implementation
- Interface-based design
- Object management

### 6. **StructAndInterfaces**
Deep dive into structs and interfaces:
- Struct vs class differences
- Explicit interface implementation
- Interface inheritance and design

### 7. **Ques**
Problem-solving and practice questions:
- Broadband plan implementations
- Person and student scholarship calculations
- Billing system implementation

### 8. **M1**
Module 1 assessments and practice:
- Delegate and event implementations
- Question-based practice problems

## Purpose

This repository is **purely for practice and learning purposes**. The code samples demonstrate various C# concepts and patterns to build proficiency with the language and object-oriented programming principles.

## Getting Started

1. Open `LibraryManagementSystem.slnx` in Visual Studio
2. Select any project to explore and run
3. Review the code to understand different C# concepts
4. Modify and experiment with the implementations

## Technologies

- C# (.NET)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Design Patterns
- Interface-based design
